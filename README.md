# caeser_cipher
The Caesar Cipher Tool is a simple encryption and decryption utility based on the Caesar cipher algorithm. It allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain value (the "shift" value). This tool provides a straightforward interface where users can input their message and specify the shift value to perform the encryption or decryption operation. The Caesar Cipher Tool is handy for basic cryptographic tasks and educational purposes, illustrating the concept of substitution ciphers.
